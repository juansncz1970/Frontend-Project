        <h2>Exploring Creativity Through Art</h2>
        <p>
          Aside from playing acoustic guitar and diving into rock music, I’m passionate about sketching and experimenting with digital art. These activities are a perfect way for me to unwind and let my creativity flow. Photography, particularly mobile photography, is another hobby I cherish, as it allows me to capture moments and tell stories through visuals.
        </p>

        <h2>Music: My Lifelong Companion</h2>
        <p>
          Rock and nu metal are my go-to genres, with bands like Slipknot, Linkin Park, System of a Down, and Deftones always on my playlist. Reggae also influences my guitar playing style, adding a unique rhythm and feel to my music. This blend of genres helps me create music that resonates with my soul.

        <h2>Recent Achievements in Photography</h2>
        <p>
          One of my proudest moments was winning the HUSAY NG SOKSAY 2022 competition, a national contest by UPLB for mobile phone photography and photo essay/journalism. This experience combined my love for visual storytelling with my passion for photography, and it’s an achievement that pushed me to pursue creative projects more seriously.

        <h2>How Hobbies Shape My Personal and Professional Life</h2>
        <p>
          My hobbies play an essential role in shaping both my personal and professional life. Music and art help me stay disciplined and creative, while photography sharpens my attention to detail and enhances my storytelling abilities. These traits are invaluable in my coding projects, where creativity and problem-solving are key.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Goals and Projects</h2>
        <p>
          Moving forward, I plan to develop my guitar techniques further, especially blending reggae with rock influences. I also want to explore other areas of photography, such as portrait or conceptual photography, and continue to grow my digital art skills to create more polished works. My hobbies are not just pastimes; they’re essential to my personal growth and how I express myself.
